# RoundingMatters

Tools for adjusting for rounding problems in meta-studies about p-hacking and publication bias. The package also contains additional tools useful in such meta-studies, e.g. for estimating density functions for absolute z-statistics without downward bias close to zero.

The functions are used in our comment on [Methods Matter: p-Hacking and Publication Bias in Causal Analysis in Economics](https://www.aeaweb.org/articles?id=10.1257/aer.20190687) by Brodeur et al. (2020).

We plan to make soon available a Github repository with the replication files for our comments, which uses this repository.
