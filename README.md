# RoundingMatters

Tools for adjusting for rounding problems in meta-studies about p-hacking and publication bias. The package also contains additional tools useful in such meta-studies, e.g. for estimating density functions for absolute z-statistics without downward bias close to zero.

The functions are used in the working paper [Rounding and other pitfalls in meta-studies on p-hacking and publication bias: A comment on Brodeur et al. (2020)](https://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=3848786) by Peter PÃ¼tz and me. A corresponding shorter comment is under review at the AER.

A Github repository with the replication files for our comments, which uses this RoundingMatters package can be found here:
